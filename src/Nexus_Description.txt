[center][size=6]Dwarven Expansion / Base Hay Capacity Patch[/size][/center]
Adds integration for Dwarven Expansion animal houses with Base Hay Capacity.

I always thought it was odd a barn or coop couldn't store any amount of hay at all. 
Base Hay Capacity alleviates that by adding a small amount of silo capacity to basic animal buildings.
As I'm using this in my own game, I decided to add support for it to Dwarven Expansion and release it for
anyone else who wants them to work together.

[size=5]Building Updates[/size]
Adds a base hay capacity to the Cave / Large Cave / Deluxe Cave animal house building based on the animal capacity of the building.

Cave: 28 hay
Large Cave: 56 hay
Deluxe Cave: 84 hay.
Cavern: 84 hay.
